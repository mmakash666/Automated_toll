How to run this repo>>>>>>>>
Ensure your machine has the latest python installed. After that download these dependencies accordingly
1. Download binary from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki (for Windows)
2. pip install tesseract
3. pip install tesseract-ocr
4. pip install pytesseract
5. ip install cv2
6. pip install easyocr
7. pip install matplotlib

note: change these (pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR/tesseract.exe") to which location you download pytesseract. But i will suggest you to let the machine decide to
download and therefore you need not to change the location path. Try without adding this file also.
